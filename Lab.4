A check constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.
They are good for making it so that a field will only take a value between 2 predefined peramiters.
The advantages are that you can now have a certain number of values and that you can make sure that everything meets 
the specs that you want.
An example of a good one is days of the week, but a bad one is days in the year. This is because there will always be
7 days in the week but there can be either 365 or 366 days in the year.
